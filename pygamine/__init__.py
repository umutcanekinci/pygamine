"""pygamine: a shared pygame-ce application/ECS/asset toolkit.

This top-level module re-exports the package's public API so consumers can
write `from pygamine import Application, GameObject, Camera` instead of
reaching into individual submodules (`pygamine.ecs.game_object`,
`pygamine.ecs.components.transform`, ...). Importing from the deeper
paths still works -- this is purely a convenience surface, not a move --
but new code should prefer the shallow form.

Exports are resolved lazily (PEP 562's module `__getattr__`), not imported
eagerly here, on purpose: `asset_manager`/`tilemap` pull in `pyyaml`/
`pytmx`, and not every consumer of this package uses those subsystems (some
projects deliberately skip the YAML-driven AssetManager/panel system and
only depend on the ECS core). Eagerly importing everything at
`import pygamine` time would force *every* consumer to have *every*
optional dependency installed just to use `Application`/`GameObject`. Each
name below is only actually imported -- and its real dependency touched --
the first time it's accessed.
