"""Wire protocol: framing + (de)serialization, in ONE place.

Game-agnostic: it only knows how to put a Python message onto a TCP stream and
read it back. The transport (and any app built on it) reuse this so the framing
logic lives exactly once.

Wire format for every message:

    [ 4-byte big-endian unsigned length ][ <length> bytes of serialized body ]

The body codec is pluggable (see `Codec`). The default is JSON, which is safe
to read from an untrusted peer. Pickle is offered too, but read the warning on
`PickleCodec` before you reach for it.

    - encode: any object json can't handle is passed to ``to_dict()``, which must
      tag the dict with a ``"__type__"`` the decoder will recognise and return a
      fully plain (already-nested) structure.
    - decode: every dict carrying a known ``"__type__"`` is rebuilt via that
      class's ``from_dict()``; object_hook runs bottom-up, so nested objects are
      already reconstructed when their container is built.
