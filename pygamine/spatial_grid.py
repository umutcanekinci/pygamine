"""Uniform spatial hash grid for fast neighbour / overlap queries.

Buckets objects (anything exposing a `.rect`) into fixed-size cells so a query
only inspects nearby cells instead of every object. This turns O(N^2) all-pairs
scans (e.g. mob-vs-mob avoidance, entity-vs-walls collision) into roughly O(N):
each lookup touches only the handful of objects in adjacent cells.

Rebuild it each frame for moving objects; build it once for static ones.
