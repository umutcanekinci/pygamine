    locally it's nested inside a host project (src/pygamine/), but in
    pygamine's own CI it's checked out standalone with no such nesting --
    those disagree, which is exactly what broke here originally (this test
    used to assert against `Path(__file__)`, silently assuming the local
    nested layout, and failed the moment it ran in pygamine's own
    standalone CI). Build a fake <root>/src/pygamine/pygamine/assets/paths.py
    tree in tmp_path and point paths.py's own `__file__` at it instead, so
    the assertion holds the same way regardless of where this test suite
    itself happens to be checked out.

    Also deliberately not just `root.is_dir()`: every ancestor of a real
    file is itself a real, existing directory, so that assertion alone
    would pass even at the wrong depth (e.g. one level short) -- which is
    the regression this originally caught when paths.py moved into
    assets/ and the parents[N] index needed to grow by one but didn't.
